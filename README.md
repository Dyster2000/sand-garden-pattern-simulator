# sand-garden-pattern-simulator

This will simulate the path of the Hack Pack Sand Garden. Open with Visual Studio 2022 (Free Community version is fine).

Add your new pattern to the end of Patterns.cpp (and Patterns.h). Then add the pattern function and name in PatternSimulator.cpp

When you run it, time scale 1 = approxiate normal speed. Higher makes it run faster to check path.
